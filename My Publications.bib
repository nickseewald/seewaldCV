  abstract = {Purpose: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have proven clinical utility in platinum-sensitive breast, ovary, pancreas, and prostate cancers with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). We explored whether PARPi might be efficacious in other solid tumors and for a broader range of genomic variants. Patients and Methods: This single-arm phase II study assessed rucaparib monotherapy in patients with advanced, platinum-sensitive or -resistant solid tumors and pathogenic variants (PVs) in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D (Cohort A) or BARD1, BRIP1, FANCA, NBN, RAD51B (Cohort B). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) in cohort A. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety[SS3] [SA4] in the entire study population. Available tumors were analyzed for pre-specified exploratory objective of allele specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH). [SA7] HRD signature (HRDsig) and platinum sensitivity status were explored as biomarkers for rucaparib activity in post hoc exploratory analyses. The study was terminated early by the sponsor due to feasibility concerns. Results: Eighty-three patients were enrolled (Cohort A: 63; Cohort B: 20). Fifty-seven patients in Cohort A and 16 in Cohort B were evaluable for efficacy analysis. The[LM8] [SA9] ORR of cohort A was 16\% (95\% CI 9-27\%) and DCR was 61\% (95\% CI 48-73\%). LOH and HRDsig were available for 48\% of Cohort A and 71\% of Cohort B. Of 11 patients who had a response to treatment, 6 tumors were HRDsig+, 1 HRDsig-and 4 were unknown. The ORR and DCR were significantly greater in patients with HRDsig+ vs HRDsig-tumors (ORR: HRDsig+ 32\% [95\% CI 15-54\%] vs HRDsig-3\% [95\% CI 0-15\%], p \&lt; 0.01; DCR: HRDsig+ 74\% [95\% CI 51-88\%] vs HRDsig-38\% [95\% CI 24-55\%], p = 0.02). mPFS was numerically longer for HRDsig+ vs HRDsig-: 7.0 mos (95\% CI, 4.3 -- inf), vs. 3.0 mos (95\% CI 2.3-5.6), HR 0.57, p = 0.14. mPFS was greater for platinum sensitive vs resistant tumors (7.82 mos [95\% CI 5.5-inf] vs. 2.9 mos [95\% CI 1.8-inf], HR 0.28, p = 0.02); Neither tumor tissue of origin nor specific mutation was independently predictive of outcome. The HR for progression in tumors that were both HRDsig+ and platinum sensitive versus those that were HRDsig-and platinum resistant was 0.09 (95\% CI 0.01-0.55, p = 0.047). The Rucaparib safety profile was consistent with prior studies. Conclusion: Rucaparib has activity across solid tumors with PVs in HRR genes, regardless of tissue of origin. Patients with platinum resistant or HRDsig-tumors had limited clinical benefit from rucaparib. The combined use of HRDsig and platinum sensitivity to predict sensitivity to PARPi is encouraging as a biomarker strategy and warrants prospective study.Citation Format: Sriram Anbil, Nicholas J Seewald, Kevin Lin, Marcia Craib, Christy Connor, Heidi Giordano, Karen McLachlan, Tanya Kwan, Lara Maloney, Hanna Tukachinsky, Alexa Schrock, Shuoguo Wang, Ethan Sokol, Brennan Decker, Katherine Nathanson, Susan Domchek, Kim Reiss.

In the entire study population, DCR was 65\% (95\% CI, 53 to 76), median PFS (mPFS) 5.5 months (95\% CI, 3.68 to 7.82), and median OS 12.1 months (95\% CI, 10.6 to inferred). PFS and hazard of death from any cause was significantly better for platinum-sensitive tumors (mPFS: 7.8 months v 3.5 months; P = .02; hazard ratio, 0.11 [95\% CI, 0.02 to 0.55]). Tumor histology was not independently predictive of outcome. Tumors with PVs in cohort A genes were more likely to be HRDsig+ than tumors with PVs in cohort B genes. Analysis of a large commercial database showed that in noncanonical tumors with BRCA PVs, 30.2\% were HRDsig+. Conclusion Rucaparib has activity in HRDsig+ solid tumors with PVs in homologous recombination repair genes, regardless of histology. Platinum sensitivity correlated with improved outcomes.},

  abstract = {Introduction Prior retrospective data demonstrated that standardization of labor induction may reduce racial disparities in cesarean delivery and morbidity. Here, we aimed to determine the impact of prospectively implementing an induction protocol on racially disparate outcomes. Methods This was a planned secondary analysis of a type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial comparing 2 years before (PRE) and 2 years after (POST) implementation of a standardized induction protocol at two labor units (2018 to 2022). The protocol had eight components and recommended active induction management, frequent cervical exams, and amniotomy by first exam {$\geq$}4 cm. All singleton pregnancies {$\geq$}37 weeks with intact membranes requiring cervical ripening were eligible; prior cesarean delivery was excluded. Data were collected via individual chart review. This analysis included only those with self-identified race, divided into Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), and white. Poisson regression with interaction terms evaluated the protocol's impact on disparities in cesarean delivery and morbidity. Fidelity to the protocol was defined as adherence to {$\geq$}75\% of the eight protocol components. Results A total of 8386 patients were included (PRE = 4167; POST = 4219); 59.3\% were identified as BIPOC. BIPOC patients differed in delivery site, insurance, body mass index, parity, age, diagnosis of diabetes and hypertension, gestational age, and induction indication. BIPOC patients were more likely to undergo cesarean in the PRE (aRR 1.36[1.18--1.58]) period, and remained more likely to undergo cesarean POST-implementation (aRR 1.55[1.33--1.70]), even when controlling for differences between groups. Similarly, maternal morbidity was greater among BIPOC patients PRE-implementation (aRR 1.25[1.07--1.46]) and remained greater among BIPOC patients POST-implementation (aRR 1.34[1.14--1.58]). There was no difference by race/ethnic group in neonatal morbidity in either PRE or POST. Finally, the protocol was implemented similarly by BIPOC versus white. Conclusion Despite uniform implementation of a standardized induction protocol across race/ethnic groups, this intervention did not mitigate observed racial disparities in cesarean or maternal morbidity.},

  abstract = {Background: Exemestane is a second generation steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) used for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Variability in AI treatment efficacy and side effects seen across patients may be due, in part, to inter-patient differences in drug exposure. This exposure variability is likely caused by patient genetics factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug metabolizing enzymes, or clinical factors such as patient body size, organ function, and comorbidities. The objective of this secondary correlative analysis was to identify genetic and clinical characteristics that affect steady state exemestane concentration, with a specific focus on the influence of inherited genetic variants and baseline hepatic function.Methods: 500 patients were enrolled on the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenetics (ELPh) Study and randomized to either drug. Clinical data and DNA were collected at baseline and blood samples were collected after 1 or 3 months of treatment to measure steady-state exemestane concentration via HPLC/MS. Genotyping was performed on a custom Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX that included the recently discovered low activity CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367) SNP and several other SNPs with putative functional consequence in enzymes thought to be involved in exemestane metabolism (CYP1A1/2, CYP1B1, CYP3A4, CYP4A11, AKR1C3/4, AKR7A2). Our primary hypothesis was that patients carrying CYP3A4*22 variants would have higher serum exemestane concentrations. Other SNPs and clinical characteristics (hepatic and renal function, age, body mass index (BMI), time of sample collection, prior chemotherapy) were assessed for independent association, and then adjusted for in a multivariable tobit regression model for CYP3A4*22 on log-transformed censored exemestane concentration.Results: 246 (225 randomized to exemestane arm, 21 crossed-over from letrozole arm) patients had exemestane steady state levels and were evaluable in this analysis. As hypothesized, the CYP3A4*22 polymorphism (minor allele frequency=0.06) was associated with a 54\% increase in exemestane concentration (95\% CI: 14\% - 109\%, p\&lt;0.01). Exemestane concentration was 44\% greater in patients who had evidence of hepatic impairment (AST or ALT\&gt;40) at baseline (95\% CI: 2\% - 104\%, p=0.02), 1\% lower per unit increase in BMI (95\% CI: 0\% - 3\%, p=0.05), and 20\% lower in patients who received prior chemotherapy (95\% CI: 4\% - 34\%, p=0.03). Age, renal impairment, and other SNPs were not associated with exemestane concentration. After adjustment for significant clinical covariates the CYP3A4*22 SNP remained significant (p\&lt;0.01).Conclusions: Genetic and clinical predictors of exemestane concentration were discovered in a large cohort of prospectively enrolled estrogen responsive breast cancer patients. Ongoing analyses will determine whether the variability in exemestane concentration was associated with downstream effects on estrogen depletion or treatment-related toxicity. If so, these genetic and clinical characteristics could be useful for individualizing dosing of exemestane to ensure that all patients are receiving maximal benefit with minimal toxicity.Citation Format: Hertz DL, Kidwell KM, Seewald NJ, Gersch CL, Desta Z, Flockhart DA, Storniolo AM, Stearns V, Skaar TC, Hayes DF, Henry NL, Rae JM.

  abstract = {4151 Background: Pancreatic cancers (PDACs) with BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants (PVs) are prognostically favorable and predict response to platinum-based treatment. Recent data suggest that these mutations may be more strongly associated with cancers arising from the body/tail (B/T) compared to the head of the pancreas (HOP). Primary tumors of the B/T are known to frequently metastasize to the peritoneum, which is thought to be largely due to anatomic location. We hypothesized that BRCA1/2 PVs may interact with tumor location in determining sites of metastatic spread. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using a database of patients with BRCA1/2 PVs and PDAC as well as wildtype (WT) control patients matched for age, sex, year and stage at diagnosis. Demographic and clinical data were compared by Fisher's exact test. Adjusted odds ratios for each site of metastasis or somatic variant were estimated using logistic regression with backwards stepwise AIC minimization. Cases with diagnosed metastases and available next generation somatic sequencing were included in the respective logistic regression models. Results: Patients with BRCA1/2 PVs were more likely to have masses in the B/T compared to control patients [51.6\% vs 31.0\%; p-value {$<$} 0.001]. After adjusting for age, sex, platinum-based chemotherapy, curative-intent surgical resection, and primary location, patients with BRCA1/2 PVs were less likely to develop peritoneal metastases compared to control patients (see table, row 3). Additionally, for patients with B/T masses, the rate of peritoneal spread was significantly lower in those with BRCA1/2PVs compared to those without (OR: 0.41 [0.20, 0.83]). We did not observe a significant association between BRCA1/2 PV and peritoneal spread in patients with HOP masses (OR: 1.09 [0.48, 2.5]). Furthermore, patients with BRCA1/2PVs were significantly less likely to have a TP53 mutation compared to controls (51\% vs 71\%; p = 0.038). This association persisted after adjusting for the variables described above (see table, row 3). No significant differences were found for mutations in KRAS (83\% vs 86\%; p = 0.60), SMAD4 (16\% vs 13\%; p = 0.59), or CDKN2A (19\% vs 29\%; p = 0.13). Conclusions: Our data suggest that patients with BRCA1/2-related PDAC are more likely to present with B/T masses compared to WT patients, are less likely to have TP53 mutations and are less likely to have peritoneal spread of disease. These data support that the prognostic benefit of BRCA-related PDAC may be linked to a favorable somatic mutation profile. ~	Liver	Lungs	Peritoneum	TP53 OR1 [CI] Group	1.64 [0.93, 2.95]	1.00 [0.61, 1.62]	0.79 [0.48, 1.28]	0.50 [0.25, 0.96] OR2 [CI] Model 1 + Age, Sex, Platinum, Surgery	1.56 [0.84, 2.94]	0.97 [0.59, 1.59]	0.76 [0.46, 1.24]	0.50 [0.25, 0.96] OR3 [CI] Model 2 + Primary Location	1.56 [0.84, 2.94]	0.92 [0.55, 1.50]	0.43 [0.21, 0.89]	0.25 [0.07, 0.74] P-value OR3	0.161	0.728	0.025	0.018 EXPAND TABLE OPEN IN VIEWER}

  abstract = {e16326 Background: BRCA1/2 germline or somatic pathogenic variants (PVs) are found in 5-10\% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Recent data suggest that BRCA2 PVs may be associated with increased overall survival (OS) compared to BRCA1 PVs after adjusting for treatment and clinical characteristics. Additionally, pancreatic tail PDAC was found to harbor PVs in BRCA1/2 more frequently compared to PDAC within the pancreatic head (HOP). We hypothesized that tumor location in patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 PVs would associate with overall survival and somatic mutation profile. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a database of patients with PDAC and BRCA1/2 PVs at an academic center. Demographic and clinical data were compared by Fisher's exact test. OS was measured using date of death or last follow-up and compared by Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and curative-intent surgical resection. Cases with available next generation somatic sequencing were reviewed. Results: There were no significant differences in age, sex, stage at diagnosis, ECOG status at diagnosis, tumor location, treatments, or sites of metastasis between patients with BRCA1 vs BRCA2 PVs. In the overall cohort, we observed no significant difference in OS between patients with BRCA1 vs BRCA2 (17.0 vs 20.2 months). However, survival analysis stratified by tumor location demonstrated that BRCA1 patients with HOP tumors had significantly worse OS compared to BRCA2 patients with HOP tumors (13.1 vs 25.7 months, p = 0.014) and had a significantly higher rate of TP53 mutations (100\% vs 50\%, p = 0.032). No significant differences in OS or rates of TP53 mutations were observed in the body/tail of the pancreas. Conclusions: These results suggest that there may be differences in rates of somatic variants between BRCA1- and BRCA2-related HOP PDAC and suggest an interaction between BRCA1/2 tumor biology and anatomical location.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Early discontinuation of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is common and leads to poor outcomes but is challenging to predict. In the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenetics trial, a high rate of early discontinuation due to intolerance was observed. We hypothesized that early changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) predict AI discontinuation and that biochemical factors are associated with changes in PROs. PATIENTS AND METHODS Postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer enrolled in a prospective randomized trial of exemestane versus letrozole completed questionnaires at baseline and serially over 24 months to assess overall quality of life (EuroQOL Visual Analog Scale [VAS]); mood; and multiple symptoms, including a musculoskeletal symptom cluster. A joint mixed-effects/survival model was used to estimate the effect of the change in PROs on AI discontinuation. Associations between biochemical factors and change in PROs were examined. RESULTS A total of 490 patients were analyzed. Worsening of EuroQOL VAS and the musculoskeletal cluster were associated with the highest risk for early discontinuation (hazard ratio [HR], 2.77 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 2.72-2.81; p = .015]; HR, 4.39 [95\% CI, 2.40-8.02; p {\textbackslash}textless .0001], respectively). Pharmacokinetics and estrogen metabolism were not consistently associated with change in PRO measures. No clinically significant differences in any PRO between AIs were observed. CONCLUSION Changes in PROs early during AI therapy were associated with treatment discontinuation. Identification of these changes could be used to target interventions in patients at high risk for early discontinuation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Early changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) can predict nonpersistence to aromatase inhibitor therapy. If used in clinical practice, PROs might identify women at highest risk for early discontinuation and allow for interventions to improve tolerance before significant toxicities develop. Further research is needed to improve capturing PROs in routine clinical practice.},

Such strategies that more closely mimic real practice, are known as dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs). A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a multi-stage trial design that can be used to construct effective DTRs. This article reviews a simple to use `weighted and replicated' estimation technique for comparing DTRs embedded in a SMART design using logistic regression for a binary, end-of-study outcome variable. Based on a Wald test that compares two embedded DTRs of interest from the `weighted and replicated' regression model, a sample size calculation is presented with a corresponding user-friendly applet to aid in the process of designing a SMART. The analytic models and sample size calculations are presented for three of the more commonly used two-stage SMART designs. Simulations for the sample size calculation show the empirical power reaches expected levels. A data analysis example with corresponding code is presented in the appendix using data from a SMART developing an effective DTR in autism.},

Inner-sphere redox reactions involve both changes in oxida-tion state and changes in bonding. Classically, in reactions such as the oxygen atom transfer (OAT) 1 reaction depicted in eqn (1a), the changes in oxidation state and those in bonding are co-localized: molybdenum is both oxidized and forms a new bond to oxygen, while nitrogen is reduced and the N--O bond is broken. Co-localization is not, however, obligatory. For example, in complexes with redox-active ligands, bonding changes may take place at a redox-inert metal center while the corresponding changes in oxidation state take place at the coordinated ligand (eqn (1b)). The most thoroughly studied example of such a ''non-classical'' inner-sphere redox reaction is proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), where the motion of the hydrogen nucleus may be quite separated from the motion of the electron. 2 In contrast to PCET, nonclassical OAT (eqn (1b)) would be a two-electron redox process. {\dh}1a{\TH}},

  abstract = {731 Background: EV+P received accelerated approval (AA) for cisplatin (cis)-ineligible aUC patients in April 2023 (EV-103) and full approval (FA) for all previously untreated patients in December 2023 (EV-302). In EV-302 trial, median durations of treatment with EV+P was 9.4 months (7.0 and 8.5 months for EV and P, respectively). We previously demonstrated high uptake of EV+P post AA in the real-world. Here, we examine rwToT with 1L EV+P with nearly 1 year of follow-up post-AA. Methods: This descriptive, post-marketing, retrospective cohort study used the Flatiron Health longitudinal database derived from EHR records of US patients with aUC initiating 1L EV+P after April 5, 2023 (AA) but before December 15, 2023 (FA). rwToT for EV+P was defined as length from first administration date of EV+P regimen to 1L therapy discontinuation, defined as last administration date of either component (i.e., EV or P) if patient initiated a next line of therapy, died during therapy, or had a gap of {$>$}60 days between last recorded dose and last contact date. rwToT was also estimated for each EV+P component. If no discontinuation criteria were met, the patient was censored at data cut-off (March 31, 2024). The Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis of rwToT, including median rwToT (months) and 30-, 90-, 180-day on-treatment rates (\%). Results: We identified 111 patients with aUC who initiated 1L EV+P after AA but before FA (mean age: 73.9 y, 75.7\% male, 77.0\% white, 23.7\% ECOG performance status {$\geq$}2, 75.2\% cis-ineligible, and 84.7\% from community practices). As of March 31, 2024, approximately 41.4\% (n=46) discontinued both EV and P; 9.9\% [n=11] began subsequent therapy, 27.0\% [n=30] died, and remaining patients were censored at end of follow-up (58.6\%, n=65). Median rwToT (95\% confidence interval [CI]) for EV+P, EV, and P were 8.2 months (6.5-not reached [NR]), 7.2 months (5.2-NR), and NR (6.3-NR), respectively (on-treatment rates reported in Table). Among 1L EV+P treated patients receiving subsequent therapies, 72.7\% (9/11) received gemcitabine and carboplatin as the first subsequent therapy. Conclusions: In this large and predominantly cis-ineligible cohort of advanced urothelial cancer patients treated with EV+P in contemporary practice, rwTOT approximated duration of treatment in clinical trials. Most 1L EV+P users receiving subsequent anticancer therapy received platinum-based chemotherapy.

  abstract = {Policy implementation is a key component of scaling effective chronic disease prevention and management interventions. Policy can support scale-up by mandating or incentivizing intervention adoption, but enacting a policy is only the first step. Fully implementing a policy designed to facilitate implementation of health interventions often requires a range of accompanying implementation structures, like health IT systems, and implementation strategies, like training. Decision makers need to know what policies can support intervention adoption and how to implement those policies, but to date research on policy implementation is limited and innovative methodological approaches are needed. In December 2021, the Johns Hopkins ALACRITY Center for Health and Longevity in Mental Illness and the Johns Hopkins Center for Mental Health and Addiction Policy convened a forum of research experts to discuss approaches for studying policy implementation. In this report, we summarize the ideas that came out of the forum. First, we describe a motivating example focused on an Affordable Care Act Medicaid health home waiver policy used by some US states to support scale-up of an evidence-based integrated care model shown in clinical trials to improve cardiovascular care for people with serious mental illness. Second, we define key policy implementation components including structures, strategies, and outcomes. Third, we provide an overview of descriptive, predictive and associational, and causal approaches that can be used to study policy implementation. We conclude with discussion of priorities for methodological innovations in policy implementation research, with three key areas identified by forum experts: effect modification methods for making causal inferences about how policies' effects on outcomes vary based on implementation structures/strategies; causal mediation approaches for studying policy implementation mechanisms; and characterizing uncertainty in systems science models. We conclude with discussion of overarching methods considerations for studying policy implementation, including measurement of policy implementation, strategies for studying the role of context in policy implementation, and the importance of considering when establishing causality is the goal of policy implementation research.},

  abstract = {Background: Height recorded in electronic health records (EHRs) is used extensively in diagnosis and treatment, either in isolation or as a component of body-mass index (BMI), but is often falsely high because many adults overestimate their height. Statistical models to predict height could therefore improve population health, but to date models have required extensive input and have not been externally validated. Methods: We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to develop sex-stratified predictive models for examiner-measured height based on self-reported height and age in a random 90\% sample of data. We internally validated the model in a held-out 10\% sample and externally validated the model in two cohorts: The National Adolescent to Adult Longitudinal Health Study (Add Health) and the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We assessed discrimination with C-index, calibration by visual inspection of calibration plots, and accuracy using root mean square error (RMSE). Results: Models were trained using 62,032 NHANES subjects (51.9\% women, 21.7\% Black, 23.9\% Hispanic or Latino, with median age 48 [IQR 31 - 64]), and evaluated in the NHANES held-out test set (n=6,846), Add Health (n=5,749), and HRS (n=5,655). Models demonstrated excellent discrimination in all validation cohorts (C-index range 0.88 - 0.89). Models were well-calibrated in all validation cohorts. Model-predicted height demonstrated lower root mean square error (RMSE) compared to self-reported height in all validation cohorts and when stratified by race and ethnicity, with greatest improvements in participants aged 45 and over. Conclusions and Relevance: A model requiring minimal input data improves estimation of height over self-reported height at least as much as more complex models across stratifications of sex, age, race and ethnicity in internal validation, and is the first model to improve height estimation that has demonstrated external validity.},

Patients were 55.3\% male; 17.3\% Black and 6.1\% Hispanic or Latino; and overall in-hospital mortality was 10.9\%. The adjusted in-hospital mortality was elevated during the pandemic in COVID-negative (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.3 [95\% CI, 1.2-1.3]) and COVID-positive (aOR, 4.3 [95\% CI, 3.8-4.8]) patients and returned to baseline by mid-2022. The median ICU length of stay was 2.1 (IQR, 1.1-4.2) days, with increases during the pandemic among COVID-positive patients (difference for COVID-positive vs COVID-negative patients, 2.0 days [95\% CI, 2.0-2.1]). Rates of invasive mechanical ventilation were 23.2\% (95\% CI, 23.1\%-23.2\%) before the pandemic, increased to 25.8\% (95\% CI, 25.8\%-25.9\%) during the pandemic, and declined below prepandemic baseline thereafter (22.0\% [95\% CI, 21.9\%-22.2\%]). The use of vasopressors increased from 7.2\% to 21.6\% of ICU stays.Pandemic-era increases in length of stay and adjusted in-hospital mortality among US ICU patients returned to recent historical baselines. Fewer patients are now receiving mechanical ventilation than prior to the pandemic, while more patients are administered vasopressor medications.},

  abstract = {In the solid state, tris(3,5-di-tert-butylcatecholato)molybdenum(VI) forms a dimer with seven-coordinate molybdenum and bridging catecholates. NMR spectroscopy indicates that the dimeric structure is retained in solution. The molybdenum center has a high affinity for Lewis bases such as pyridine or pyridine-N-oxide, forming seven-coordinate monomers with a capped octahedral geometry, as illustrated by the solid-state structure of (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(py). Structural data indicate that the complexes are best considered as Mo(VI) with substantial {$\pi$} donation from the nonbridging catecholates to molybdenum. Both the dimeric and the monomeric tris(catecholates) react rapidly with water to form free catechol and oxomolybdenum bis(catecholate) complexes. Monooxomolybdenum complexes are also obtained, more slowly, on reaction with dioxygen, with organic products consisting mostly of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone with minor amounts of the extradiol oxidation product 4,6-di-tert-butyl-1-oxacyclohepta-4,6-diene-2,3-dione. The pyridine-N-oxide complex reacts on heating (with excess pyO) to form initially (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2MoO(Opy) and ultimately MoO3(Opy), with quinone and free pyridine as the only organic products. The decay of (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(Opy) shows an accelerated, autocatalytic profile because the oxidation of its product, (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2MoO(Opy), produces an oxo-rich, catecholate-poor intermediate which rapidly conproportionates with (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(Opy), providing an additional pathway for its conversion to the mono-oxo product. The tris(catecholate) fragment Mo(3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3 deoxygenates Opy in this nonclassical oxygen atom transfer reaction slightly less rapidly than does its oxidized product, MoO(3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2.},

  abstract = {Clinicians and researchers alike are increasingly interested in how best to personalize interventions. A dynamic treatment regimen (DTR) is a sequence of pre-specified decision rules which can be used to guide the delivery of a sequence of treatments or interventions that are tailored to the changing needs of the individual. The sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a research tool which allows for the construction of effective DTRs. SMARTs are multi-stage randomized trials in which some or all participants are randomized more than once, with each randomization corresponding to an open scientific question which will aid in the development of a high-quality DTR. In this dissertation, we develop a suite of tools which aid investigators in the design and analysis of SMARTs with continuous, longitudinal outcomes which are collected throughout the multiple stages of the trial.  We begin by deriving easy-to-use formulae for computing the total sample size for three common two-stage SMART designs in which the primary aim is to compare mean end-of-study outcomes for two embedded DTRs which recommend different first-stage treatments. The formulae are derived in the context of a regression model which leverages information from a longitudinal outcome collected over the entire study. We show that the sample size formula for a SMART can be written as the product of the sample size formula for a standard two-arm randomized trial, a deflation factor that accounts for the increased statistical efficiency resulting from a longitudinal analysis, and an inflation factor that accounts for the design of a SMART. The SMART design inflation factor is typically a function of the anticipated probability of response to first-stage treatment. We review modeling and estimation for DTR effect analyses using a longitudinal outcome from a SMART, as well as the estimation of standard errors. We also present estimators for the covariance matrix for a variety of common working correlation structures. Methods are motivated using the ENGAGE study, a SMART aimed at developing a DTR for increasing motivation to attend treatments among alcohol- and cocaine-dependent patients. Randomized trials are often constrained by limited financial resources; SMARTs are no different. The longitudinal deflation factor we develop allows for reduction in sample size requirements via both within-person correlation and the repeated measurements of the outcome over time. We provide guidance on how to balance sample size and the number of measurement occasions to minimize total cost of recruitment and measurement while achieving a target power. Finally, we introduce a procedure to generate data from a longitudinal SMART that will achieve an arbitrary desired covariance structure on potential outcomes, averaged over response status. This procedure, as well as user-friendly sample size tools which solve the cost optimization problems, are available in an R package called longsmart.},

A just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) adjusts to an individual's changing state and/or context to provide the right treatment, at the right time, in the right place. Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) allow for the collection of data which aid in the construction of an optimized JITAI by sequentially randomizing participants to different treatment options at each of many decision points throughout the study. Often, these data are collected passively using a mobile phone. To assess the causal effect of treatment on a near-term outcome, care must be taken when designing the data collection system to ensure it is of appropriately high quality. Here, we make several recommendations for collecting and managing data from an MRT. We provide advice on selecting which features to collect and when, choosing between ``agents'' to implement randomization, identifying sources of missing data, and overcoming other novel challenges. The recommendations are informed by our experience with HeartSteps, an MRT designed to test the effects of an intervention aimed at increasing physical activity in sedentary adults. We also provide a checklist which can be used in designing a data collection system so that scientists can focus more on their questions of interest, and less on cleaning data.},

Stacked difference-in-differences is an increasingly popular way to estimate these effects. This approach involves estimating treatment effects for each policy-implementing unit, then, if scientifically appropriate, aggregating them to an average effect estimate. However, when individual-level data are available and non-implementing units are used as comparators for multiple policy-implementing units, data from untreated individuals may be used across multiple analyses, thereby inducing correlation between effect estimates. Existing methods do not quantify or account for this sharing of controls. Here, we describe a stacked difference-in-differences study investigating the effects of state medical cannabis laws on treatment for chronic pain management that motivated this work, discuss a framework for estimating and managing this correlation due to shared control individuals, and show how accounting for it affects the substantive results.},

Most commonly used outside of policy contexts, this approach is also valuable for policy evaluation as policies typically are not randomly assigned. In this article, we discuss the application of the target trial emulation framework in a policy evaluation context. The policy trial emulation framework includes 7 components: the units and eligibility criteria, definitions of the exposure and comparison conditions, assignment mechanism, baseline (``time zero'') and follow-up, outcomes, causal estimand, and statistical analysis and assumptions. Policy evaluations that emulate a randomized trial across these dimensions can yield estimates of the causal effects of the policy on outcomes. Using the policy trial emulation framework to conduct and report on research design and methods supports transparent assessment of threats to causal inference in nonexperimental studies intended to assess the effect of a health policy on clinical or population health outcomes.},

This framework is intended to help researchers in identifying and testing key digital therapeutics design considerations across the intervention development lifespan---that is, from formative work through longer-term implementation. The framework encourages intervention developers to make design decisions by considering three motivating questions: first, what health outcomes are we trying to impact; second, what are we trying to learn; and third, cross-cutting both prior questions to inform potential evidence, how much is at stake in terms of health impacts if we get this decision wrong? We consider how these questions can help to inform design decisions across three phases of the intervention lifespan---preparation and formative work, optimization of intervention components, and evaluation of effectiveness and implementation---to maximize the likelihood of positive health impact and accumulation of evidence about the intervention's functioning.},

Interviewees described the intensive process of agency integration and identified primarily positive (e.g., decreased administrative burden) impacts of integration. Quantitative analyses indicated no effects of integration on receipt of mental health-related services among people with co-occurring conditions. While leaders identified some potentially beneficial impacts of state agency integration, the limited impact of integration beyond the agency suggests that interventions at multiple levels of the service system, including those targeting providers, are needed to better meet the mental health service needs for this population.},

PrEP coverage (prescriptions per 100,000 population) increased over time but was not statistically significantly associated with Medicaid expansion. There were, however, significant increases in the PrEP-to-need ratio (4.44 PrEP prescriptions per new HIV diagnosis) that were attributable to Medicaid expansion, with the strength of effects increasing over time. Medicaid expansion was associated with significant increases in PrEP-to-need ratios across all subgroups.

  abstract = {Background: Recurrence after early-stage breast cancer (BC) is a challenge, occurring in {$\sim$}30\% of patients (pts). Recurrences may arise from reactivation of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) persisting in a dormant state after primary treatment. The presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) as bone marrow DTCs and/or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood increases the risk of BC recurrence/death. It remains unclear which pts with DTCs will have these reactivate or develop detectable ctDNA before clinical relapse. We evaluated the association and temporal relationship of ctDNA with DTCs in a population of high-risk BC survivors, and the relationship of these markers with subsequent metastatic recurrence. Methods: ``PENN SURMOUNT'' is a single center, prospective, longitudinal cohort study examining MRD biomarkers among pts within 5 years (y) of BC diagnosis who completed all curative treatment except endocrine therapy. Eligible pts must have had: 1) TNBC, or 2) HER2+ or HR+ BC with positive LN and/or residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy, or 3) HR+ BC with a 21-gene Recurrence score \&gt;25 and/or high risk Mammaprint. Pts had annual bone marrow aspirate (BMA) for DTCs by immunohistochemistry (using methods of Naume et al.). DTC+ pts went on therapeutic trial; DTC- pts had up to 5y of annual BMA and blood testing. ctDNA was retrospectively assessed using the RaDaR assay, which targets pt-specific somatic mutations identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES) of primary tumor tissue. Results: Of 184 pts enrolled from 2016 -- 2021, 121 had tissue available; 114/121 (94\%) had successful WES. A total of 338 plasma samples from 96 pts (median 2 timepoints each, range 1-12) have been successfully tested by RaDaR to date. Overall, ctDNA was detected in 11 samples from 9/96 pts (9.3\%) with a median eVAF of 0.009\% (range 0.002-0.084\%). Two pts were ctDNA+ at baseline (BL), and 7 became positive on surveillance. 87/96 (90.6\%) were ctDNA- across all timepoints. 34/96 pts (35\%) were DTC+, either at BL (n=24, 25\%) or after (n=10, 10\%). Considering all timepoints, concordance was 64\%. Of 34 ever-DTC+ pts, 4 (12\%) were ctDNA+ (of whom 3/4 recurred) and 30 remained ctDNA- (with 1/30 who recurred). Among the 62 pts who remained DTC-, 5 (8\%) were ctDNA+ (with 5/5 who recurred), and 57 remained ctDNA- (of whom 5/57 recurred). All ctDNA positivity in DTC+ pts occurred at the time of or after DTC positivity. Over median follow-up (f/u) of 65 months (m), BC recurrence occurred in 14/96 pts (15\%), with 2 locoregional-only and 12 distant +/- locoregional recurrences (involving the bone, liver, lung/pleura, and brain); 8/14 pts (57\%) were ctDNA+ prior to relapse. 7/12 (58\%) with distant recurrences were ctDNA+ prior to metastatic diagnosis, at a median lead time of 15 m (range 0 -- 25). Overall, ctDNA+ pts experienced a median lead time from ctDNA positivity to recurrence of 13 m (range 0 -- 25). Only 1 of 9 ctDNA+ pts has not recurred; this pt was DTC+ and went on therapeutic trial, without evidence of recurrence over 20 m f/u. 30/34 DTC+ pts (89\%) who went on therapeutic trial have not had ctDNA detected during f/u and have not recurred. Overall, ctDNA status was significantly associated with relapse (p\&lt;0.01), with a PPV of 89\% and NPV of 93\%. Of the 24 BL DTC+ pts, 2 became ctDNA+ at subsequent timepoints, an average of 18 m after DTC assessment, and both relapsed (3 and 5 m from ctDNA detection, respectively). Conclusions: In this surveillance study of high-risk BC pts, DTC+ pts were identified who subsequently developed detectable ctDNA and clinical relapse. Where there were discordant results, the timing of DTC and ctDNA positivity revealed a window of opportunity for intervention. A strategy combining both markers for surveillance and intervention to prevent metastatic disease may be of value.Citation Format: Eleanor Taranto, Nicholas J. Seewald, Lauren J.

  abstract = {Noninvasive prognostic biomarkers to inform clinical decision-making are an urgent unmet need for the management of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). We previously showed that higher circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) concentration is associated with worse survival in GBM. However, the biology underlying this is unknown.We prospectively enrolled 129 patients with treatment-na{\"i}ve GBM with blood drawn prior to initial resection (baseline) and at the time of the first postradiotherapy MRI. We performed ccfDNA methylation deconvolution to determine cellular sources of ccfDNA. ELISA was performed to detect citrullinated histone 3 (citH3), a marker of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Multiplex proteomic analysis was used to measure soluble inflammatory proteins.We found that neutrophils contributed the highest proportion of prognostic ccfDNA. The percentage of ccfDNA derived from neutrophils was correlated with total [ccfDNA] but only in patients receiving preoperative corticosteroids. At baseline and on therapy, [citH3] was significantly higher in the plasma of patients with GBM receiving corticosteroids compared with corticosteroid-na{\"i}ve GBM or no-cancer controls. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of ccfDNA methylation patterns yielded two clusters, with one enriched for patients with the NETosis phenotype and who received corticosteroids. Unsupervised clustering of circulating inflammatory proteins yielded similar results.These data suggest neutrophil-mediated NETosis is the dominant source of prognostic ccfDNA in patients with GBM and may be associated with glucocorticoid exposure. If further studies show that pharmacological inhibition of NETosis can mitigate the deleterious effects of corticosteroids, these plasma markers will have important clinical utility as noninvasive correlative biomarkers.},
