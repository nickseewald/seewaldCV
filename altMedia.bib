  abstract = {Public health interventions aim to help populations, but no one approach works for everyone. This raises key questions: What do we do when people don't respond to initial treatments? And why do trials test static interventions when real-world care adapts over time? To discuss innovative methods that tackle these issues, host Alfredo Morabia speaks with Dr. Bibhas Chakraborty of Duke-NUS Medical School and Nick Seewald of Johns Hopkins University.}
