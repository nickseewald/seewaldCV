  abstract = {Purpose: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have proven clinical utility in platinum-sensitive breast, ovary, pancreas, and prostate cancers with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). We explored whether PARPi might be efficacious in other solid tumors and for a broader range of genomic variants. Patients and Methods: This single-arm phase II study assessed rucaparib monotherapy in patients with advanced, platinum-sensitive or -resistant solid tumors and pathogenic variants (PVs) in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D (Cohort A) or BARD1, BRIP1, FANCA, NBN, RAD51B (Cohort B). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) in cohort A. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety[SS3] [SA4] in the entire study population. Available tumors were analyzed for pre-specified exploratory objective of allele specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH). [SA7] HRD signature (HRDsig) and platinum sensitivity status were explored as biomarkers for rucaparib activity in post hoc exploratory analyses. The study was terminated early by the sponsor due to feasibility concerns. Results: Eighty-three patients were enrolled (Cohort A: 63; Cohort B: 20). Fifty-seven patients in Cohort A and 16 in Cohort B were evaluable for efficacy analysis. The[LM8] [SA9] ORR of cohort A was 16\% (95\% CI 9-27\%) and DCR was 61\% (95\% CI 48-73\%). LOH and HRDsig were available for 48\% of Cohort A and 71\% of Cohort B. Of 11 patients who had a response to treatment, 6 tumors were HRDsig+, 1 HRDsig-and 4 were unknown. The ORR and DCR were significantly greater in patients with HRDsig+ vs HRDsig-tumors (ORR: HRDsig+ 32\% [95\% CI 15-54\%] vs HRDsig-3\% [95\% CI 0-15\%], p \&lt; 0.01; DCR: HRDsig+ 74\% [95\% CI 51-88\%] vs HRDsig-38\% [95\% CI 24-55\%], p = 0.02). mPFS was numerically longer for HRDsig+ vs HRDsig-: 7.0 mos (95\% CI, 4.3 – inf), vs. 3.0 mos (95\% CI 2.3-5.6), HR 0.57, p = 0.14. mPFS was greater for platinum sensitive vs resistant tumors (7.82 mos [95\% CI 5.5-inf] vs. 2.9 mos [95\% CI 1.8-inf], HR 0.28, p = 0.02); Neither tumor tissue of origin nor specific mutation was independently predictive of outcome. The HR for progression in tumors that were both HRDsig+ and platinum sensitive versus those that were HRDsig-and platinum resistant was 0.09 (95\% CI 0.01-0.55, p = 0.047). The Rucaparib safety profile was consistent with prior studies. Conclusion: Rucaparib has activity across solid tumors with PVs in HRR genes, regardless of tissue of origin. Patients with platinum resistant or HRDsig-tumors had limited clinical benefit from rucaparib. The combined use of HRDsig and platinum sensitivity to predict sensitivity to PARPi is encouraging as a biomarker strategy and warrants prospective study.Citation Format: Sriram Anbil, Nicholas J Seewald, Kevin Lin, Marcia Craib, Christy Connor, Heidi Giordano, Karen McLachlan, Tanya Kwan, Lara Maloney, Hanna Tukachinsky, Alexa Schrock, Shuoguo Wang, Ethan Sokol, Brennan Decker, Katherine Nathanson, Susan Domchek, Kim Reiss.

  abstract = {Background: Exemestane is a second generation steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) used for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Variability in AI treatment efficacy and side effects seen across patients may be due, in part, to inter-patient differences in drug exposure. This exposure variability is likely caused by patient genetics factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug metabolizing enzymes, or clinical factors such as patient body size, organ function, and comorbidities. The objective of this secondary correlative analysis was to identify genetic and clinical characteristics that affect steady state exemestane concentration, with a specific focus on the influence of inherited genetic variants and baseline hepatic function.Methods: 500 patients were enrolled on the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenetics (ELPh) Study and randomized to either drug. Clinical data and DNA were collected at baseline and blood samples were collected after 1 or 3 months of treatment to measure steady-state exemestane concentration via HPLC/MS. Genotyping was performed on a custom Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX that included the recently discovered low activity CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367) SNP and several other SNPs with putative functional consequence in enzymes thought to be involved in exemestane metabolism (CYP1A1/2, CYP1B1, CYP3A4, CYP4A11, AKR1C3/4, AKR7A2). Our primary hypothesis was that patients carrying CYP3A4*22 variants would have higher serum exemestane concentrations. Other SNPs and clinical characteristics (hepatic and renal function, age, body mass index (BMI), time of sample collection, prior chemotherapy) were assessed for independent association, and then adjusted for in a multivariable tobit regression model for CYP3A4*22 on log-transformed censored exemestane concentration.Results: 246 (225 randomized to exemestane arm, 21 crossed-over from letrozole arm) patients had exemestane steady state levels and were evaluable in this analysis. As hypothesized, the CYP3A4*22 polymorphism (minor allele frequency=0.06) was associated with a 54\% increase in exemestane concentration (95\% CI: 14\% - 109\%, p\&lt;0.01). Exemestane concentration was 44\% greater in patients who had evidence of hepatic impairment (AST or ALT\&gt;40) at baseline (95\% CI: 2\% - 104\%, p=0.02), 1\% lower per unit increase in BMI (95\% CI: 0\% - 3\%, p=0.05), and 20\% lower in patients who received prior chemotherapy (95\% CI: 4\% - 34\%, p=0.03). Age, renal impairment, and other SNPs were not associated with exemestane concentration. After adjustment for significant clinical covariates the CYP3A4*22 SNP remained significant (p\&lt;0.01).Conclusions: Genetic and clinical predictors of exemestane concentration were discovered in a large cohort of prospectively enrolled estrogen responsive breast cancer patients. Ongoing analyses will determine whether the variability in exemestane concentration was associated with downstream effects on estrogen depletion or treatment-related toxicity. If so, these genetic and clinical characteristics could be useful for individualizing dosing of exemestane to ensure that all patients are receiving maximal benefit with minimal toxicity.Citation Format: Hertz DL, Kidwell KM, Seewald NJ, Gersch CL, Desta Z, Flockhart DA, Storniolo AM, Stearns V, Skaar TC, Hayes DF, Henry NL, Rae JM.

  abstract = {4151 Background: Pancreatic cancers (PDACs) with BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants (PVs) are prognostically favorable and predict response to platinum-based treatment. Recent data suggest that these mutations may be more strongly associated with cancers arising from the body/tail (B/T) compared to the head of the pancreas (HOP). Primary tumors of the B/T are known to frequently metastasize to the peritoneum, which is thought to be largely due to anatomic location. We hypothesized that BRCA1/2 PVs may interact with tumor location in determining sites of metastatic spread. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using a database of patients with BRCA1/2 PVs and PDAC as well as wildtype (WT) control patients matched for age, sex, year and stage at diagnosis. Demographic and clinical data were compared by Fisher’s exact test. Adjusted odds ratios for each site of metastasis or somatic variant were estimated using logistic regression with backwards stepwise AIC minimization. Cases with diagnosed metastases and available next generation somatic sequencing were included in the respective logistic regression models. Results: Patients with BRCA1/2 PVs were more likely to have masses in the B/T compared to control patients [51.6\% vs 31.0\%; p-value {$<$} 0.001]. After adjusting for age, sex, platinum-based chemotherapy, curative-intent surgical resection, and primary location, patients with BRCA1/2 PVs were less likely to develop peritoneal metastases compared to control patients (see table, row 3). Additionally, for patients with B/T masses, the rate of peritoneal spread was significantly lower in those with BRCA1/2PVs compared to those without (OR: 0.41 [0.20, 0.83]). We did not observe a significant association between BRCA1/2 PV and peritoneal spread in patients with HOP masses (OR: 1.09 [0.48, 2.5]). Furthermore, patients with BRCA1/2PVs were significantly less likely to have a TP53 mutation compared to controls (51\% vs 71\%; p = 0.038). This association persisted after adjusting for the variables described above (see table, row 3). No significant differences were found for mutations in KRAS (83\% vs 86\%; p = 0.60), SMAD4 (16\% vs 13\%; p = 0.59), or CDKN2A (19\% vs 29\%; p = 0.13). Conclusions: Our data suggest that patients with BRCA1/2-related PDAC are more likely to present with B/T masses compared to WT patients, are less likely to have TP53 mutations and are less likely to have peritoneal spread of disease. These data support that the prognostic benefit of BRCA-related PDAC may be linked to a favorable somatic mutation profile. ~	Liver	Lungs	Peritoneum	TP53 OR1 [CI] Group	1.64 [0.93, 2.95]	1.00 [0.61, 1.62]	0.79 [0.48, 1.28]	0.50 [0.25, 0.96] OR2 [CI] Model 1 + Age, Sex, Platinum, Surgery	1.56 [0.84, 2.94]	0.97 [0.59, 1.59]	0.76 [0.46, 1.24]	0.50 [0.25, 0.96] OR3 [CI] Model 2 + Primary Location	1.56 [0.84, 2.94]	0.92 [0.55, 1.50]	0.43 [0.21, 0.89]	0.25 [0.07, 0.74] P-value OR3	0.161	0.728	0.025	0.018 EXPAND TABLE OPEN IN VIEWER},

  abstract = {e16326 Background: BRCA1/2 germline or somatic pathogenic variants (PVs) are found in 5-10\% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Recent data suggest that BRCA2 PVs may be associated with increased overall survival (OS) compared to BRCA1 PVs after adjusting for treatment and clinical characteristics. Additionally, pancreatic tail PDAC was found to harbor PVs in BRCA1/2 more frequently compared to PDAC within the pancreatic head (HOP). We hypothesized that tumor location in patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 PVs would associate with overall survival and somatic mutation profile. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a database of patients with PDAC and BRCA1/2 PVs at an academic center. Demographic and clinical data were compared by Fisher’s exact test. OS was measured using date of death or last follow-up and compared by Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and curative-intent surgical resection. Cases with available next generation somatic sequencing were reviewed. Results: There were no significant differences in age, sex, stage at diagnosis, ECOG status at diagnosis, tumor location, treatments, or sites of metastasis between patients with BRCA1 vs BRCA2 PVs. In the overall cohort, we observed no significant difference in OS between patients with BRCA1 vs BRCA2 (17.0 vs 20.2 months). However, survival analysis stratified by tumor location demonstrated that BRCA1 patients with HOP tumors had significantly worse OS compared to BRCA2 patients with HOP tumors (13.1 vs 25.7 months, p = 0.014) and had a significantly higher rate of TP53 mutations (100\% vs 50\%, p = 0.032). No significant differences in OS or rates of TP53 mutations were observed in the body/tail of the pancreas. Conclusions: These results suggest that there may be differences in rates of somatic variants between BRCA1- and BRCA2-related HOP PDAC and suggest an interaction between BRCA1/2 tumor biology and anatomical location.

  abstract = {731 Background: EV+P received accelerated approval (AA) for cisplatin (cis)-ineligible aUC patients in April 2023 (EV-103) and full approval (FA) for all previously untreated patients in December 2023 (EV-302). In EV-302 trial, median durations of treatment with EV+P was 9.4 months (7.0 and 8.5 months for EV and P, respectively). We previously demonstrated high uptake of EV+P post AA in the real-world. Here, we examine rwToT with 1L EV+P with nearly 1 year of follow-up post-AA. Methods: This descriptive, post-marketing, retrospective cohort study used the Flatiron Health longitudinal database derived from EHR records of US patients with aUC initiating 1L EV+P after April 5, 2023 (AA) but before December 15, 2023 (FA). rwToT for EV+P was defined as length from first administration date of EV+P regimen to 1L therapy discontinuation, defined as last administration date of either component (i.e., EV or P) if patient initiated a next line of therapy, died during therapy, or had a gap of {$>$}60 days between last recorded dose and last contact date. rwToT was also estimated for each EV+P component. If no discontinuation criteria were met, the patient was censored at data cut-off (March 31, 2024). The Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis of rwToT, including median rwToT (months) and 30-, 90-, 180-day on-treatment rates (\%). Results: We identified 111 patients with aUC who initiated 1L EV+P after AA but before FA (mean age: 73.9 y, 75.7\% male, 77.0\% white, 23.7\% ECOG performance status ≥2, 75.2\% cis-ineligible, and 84.7\% from community practices). As of March 31, 2024, approximately 41.4\% (n=46) discontinued both EV and P; 9.9\% [n=11] began subsequent therapy, 27.0\% [n=30] died, and remaining patients were censored at end of follow-up (58.6\%, n=65). Median rwToT (95\% confidence interval [CI]) for EV+P, EV, and P were 8.2 months (6.5-not reached [NR]), 7.2 months (5.2-NR), and NR (6.3-NR), respectively (on-treatment rates reported in Table). Among 1L EV+P treated patients receiving subsequent therapies, 72.7\% (9/11) received gemcitabine and carboplatin as the first subsequent therapy. Conclusions: In this large and predominantly cis-ineligible cohort of advanced urothelial cancer patients treated with EV+P in contemporary practice, rwTOT approximated duration of treatment in clinical trials. Most 1L EV+P users receiving subsequent anticancer therapy received platinum-based chemotherapy.

  abstract = {Background: Recurrence after early-stage breast cancer (BC) is a challenge, occurring in ∼30\% of patients (pts). Recurrences may arise from reactivation of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) persisting in a dormant state after primary treatment. The presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) as bone marrow DTCs and/or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood increases the risk of BC recurrence/death. It remains unclear which pts with DTCs will have these reactivate or develop detectable ctDNA before clinical relapse. We evaluated the association and temporal relationship of ctDNA with DTCs in a population of high-risk BC survivors, and the relationship of these markers with subsequent metastatic recurrence. Methods: “PENN SURMOUNT” is a single center, prospective, longitudinal cohort study examining MRD biomarkers among pts within 5 years (y) of BC diagnosis who completed all curative treatment except endocrine therapy. Eligible pts must have had: 1) TNBC, or 2) HER2+ or HR+ BC with positive LN and/or residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy, or 3) HR+ BC with a 21-gene Recurrence score \&gt;25 and/or high risk Mammaprint. Pts had annual bone marrow aspirate (BMA) for DTCs by immunohistochemistry (using methods of Naume et al.). DTC+ pts went on therapeutic trial; DTC- pts had up to 5y of annual BMA and blood testing. ctDNA was retrospectively assessed using the RaDaR assay, which targets pt-specific somatic mutations identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES) of primary tumor tissue. Results: Of 184 pts enrolled from 2016 – 2021, 121 had tissue available; 114/121 (94\%) had successful WES. A total of 338 plasma samples from 96 pts (median 2 timepoints each, range 1-12) have been successfully tested by RaDaR to date. Overall, ctDNA was detected in 11 samples from 9/96 pts (9.3\%) with a median eVAF of 0.009\% (range 0.002-0.084\%). Two pts were ctDNA+ at baseline (BL), and 7 became positive on surveillance. 87/96 (90.6\%) were ctDNA- across all timepoints. 34/96 pts (35\%) were DTC+, either at BL (n=24, 25\%) or after (n=10, 10\%). Considering all timepoints, concordance was 64\%. Of 34 ever-DTC+ pts, 4 (12\%) were ctDNA+ (of whom 3/4 recurred) and 30 remained ctDNA- (with 1/30 who recurred). Among the 62 pts who remained DTC-, 5 (8\%) were ctDNA+ (with 5/5 who recurred), and 57 remained ctDNA- (of whom 5/57 recurred). All ctDNA positivity in DTC+ pts occurred at the time of or after DTC positivity. Over median follow-up (f/u) of 65 months (m), BC recurrence occurred in 14/96 pts (15\%), with 2 locoregional-only and 12 distant +/- locoregional recurrences (involving the bone, liver, lung/pleura, and brain); 8/14 pts (57\%) were ctDNA+ prior to relapse. 7/12 (58\%) with distant recurrences were ctDNA+ prior to metastatic diagnosis, at a median lead time of 15 m (range 0 – 25). Overall, ctDNA+ pts experienced a median lead time from ctDNA positivity to recurrence of 13 m (range 0 – 25). Only 1 of 9 ctDNA+ pts has not recurred; this pt was DTC+ and went on therapeutic trial, without evidence of recurrence over 20 m f/u. 30/34 DTC+ pts (89\%) who went on therapeutic trial have not had ctDNA detected during f/u and have not recurred. Overall, ctDNA status was significantly associated with relapse (p\&lt;0.01), with a PPV of 89\% and NPV of 93\%. Of the 24 BL DTC+ pts, 2 became ctDNA+ at subsequent timepoints, an average of 18 m after DTC assessment, and both relapsed (3 and 5 m from ctDNA detection, respectively). Conclusions: In this surveillance study of high-risk BC pts, DTC+ pts were identified who subsequently developed detectable ctDNA and clinical relapse. Where there were discordant results, the timing of DTC and ctDNA positivity revealed a window of opportunity for intervention. A strategy combining both markers for surveillance and intervention to prevent metastatic disease may be of value.Citation Format: Eleanor Taranto, Nicholas J. Seewald, Lauren J.
