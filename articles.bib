  abstract = {Purpose To explore poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor utility across solid tumors and identify biomarkers that predict sensitivity. Patients and Methods This single-arm phase II study assessed rucaparib monotherapy in patients with solid tumors and pathogenic variants (PVs) in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D (cohort A) or BARD1, BRIP1, FANCA, NBN, and RAD51B (cohort B). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) in cohort A. Secondary end points included disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. A scar-based homologous recombination deficiency signature (HRDsig) and platinum sensitivity status were explored post hoc. Results Fifty-one patients in cohort A and 12 in cohort B were evaluable for efficacy. ORR of cohort A was 18\% (95\% CI, 10 to 30). A significantly higher ORR was observed with HRDsig+ tumors compared with HRDsig– tumors (32\%; 95\% CI, 15 to 54 v 0\%; 95\% CI, 0 to 14; P {$<$} .01). In the entire study population, DCR was 65\% (95\% CI, 53 to 76), median PFS (mPFS) 5.5 months (95\% CI, 3.68 to 7.82), and median OS 12.1 months (95\% CI, 10.6 to inferred). PFS and hazard of death from any cause was significantly better for platinum-sensitive tumors (mPFS: 7.8 months v 3.5 months; P = .02; hazard ratio, 0.11 [95\% CI, 0.02 to 0.55]). Tumor histology was not independently predictive of outcome. Tumors with PVs in cohort A genes were more likely to be HRDsig+ than tumors with PVs in cohort B genes. Analysis of a large commercial database showed that in noncanonical tumors with BRCA PVs, 30.2\% were HRDsig+. Conclusion Rucaparib has activity in HRDsig+ solid tumors with PVs in homologous recombination repair genes, regardless of histology. Platinum sensitivity correlated with improved outcomes.},

  abstract = {Introduction Prior retrospective data demonstrated that standardization of labor induction may reduce racial disparities in cesarean delivery and morbidity. Here, we aimed to determine the impact of prospectively implementing an induction protocol on racially disparate outcomes. Methods This was a planned secondary analysis of a type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial comparing 2 years before (PRE) and 2 years after (POST) implementation of a standardized induction protocol at two labor units (2018 to 2022). The protocol had eight components and recommended active induction management, frequent cervical exams, and amniotomy by first exam ≥4 cm. All singleton pregnancies ≥37 weeks with intact membranes requiring cervical ripening were eligible; prior cesarean delivery was excluded. Data were collected via individual chart review. This analysis included only those with self-identified race, divided into Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), and white. Poisson regression with interaction terms evaluated the protocol's impact on disparities in cesarean delivery and morbidity. Fidelity to the protocol was defined as adherence to ≥75\% of the eight protocol components. Results A total of 8386 patients were included (PRE = 4167; POST = 4219); 59.3\% were identified as BIPOC. BIPOC patients differed in delivery site, insurance, body mass index, parity, age, diagnosis of diabetes and hypertension, gestational age, and induction indication. BIPOC patients were more likely to undergo cesarean in the PRE (aRR 1.36[1.18–1.58]) period, and remained more likely to undergo cesarean POST-implementation (aRR 1.55[1.33–1.70]), even when controlling for differences between groups. Similarly, maternal morbidity was greater among BIPOC patients PRE-implementation (aRR 1.25[1.07–1.46]) and remained greater among BIPOC patients POST-implementation (aRR 1.34[1.14–1.58]). There was no difference by race/ethnic group in neonatal morbidity in either PRE or POST. Finally, the protocol was implemented similarly by BIPOC versus white. Conclusion Despite uniform implementation of a standardized induction protocol across race/ethnic groups, this intervention did not mitigate observed racial disparities in cesarean or maternal morbidity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Early discontinuation of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is common and leads to poor outcomes but is challenging to predict. In the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenetics trial, a high rate of early discontinuation due to intolerance was observed. We hypothesized that early changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) predict AI discontinuation and that biochemical factors are associated with changes in PROs. PATIENTS AND METHODS Postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer enrolled in a prospective randomized trial of exemestane versus letrozole completed questionnaires at baseline and serially over 24 months to assess overall quality of life (EuroQOL Visual Analog Scale [VAS]); mood; and multiple symptoms, including a musculoskeletal symptom cluster. A joint mixed-effects/survival model was used to estimate the effect of the change in PROs on AI discontinuation. Associations between biochemical factors and change in PROs were examined. RESULTS A total of 490 patients were analyzed. Worsening of EuroQOL VAS and the musculoskeletal cluster were associated with the highest risk for early discontinuation (hazard ratio [HR], 2.77 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 2.72-2.81; p = .015]; HR, 4.39 [95\% CI, 2.40-8.02; p \textbackslash textless .0001], respectively). Pharmacokinetics and estrogen metabolism were not consistently associated with change in PRO measures. No clinically significant differences in any PRO between AIs were observed. CONCLUSION Changes in PROs early during AI therapy were associated with treatment discontinuation. Identification of these changes could be used to target interventions in patients at high risk for early discontinuation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Early changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) can predict nonpersistence to aromatase inhibitor therapy. If used in clinical practice, PROs might identify women at highest risk for early discontinuation and allow for interventions to improve tolerance before significant toxicities develop. Further research is needed to improve capturing PROs in routine clinical practice.},

  abstract = {In behavioral, educational and medical practice, interventions are often personalized over time using strategies that are based on individual behaviors and characteristics and changes in symptoms, severity, or adherence that are a result of one’s treatment. Such strategies that more closely mimic real practice, are known as dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs). A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a multi-stage trial design that can be used to construct effective DTRs. This article reviews a simple to use ‘weighted and replicated’ estimation technique for comparing DTRs embedded in a SMART design using logistic regression for a binary, end-of-study outcome variable. Based on a Wald test that compares two embedded DTRs of interest from the ‘weighted and replicated’ regression model, a sample size calculation is presented with a corresponding user-friendly applet to aid in the process of designing a SMART. The analytic models and sample size calculations are presented for three of the more commonly used two-stage SMART designs. Simulations for the sample size calculation show the empirical power reaches expected levels. A data analysis example with corresponding code is presented in the appendix using data from a SMART developing an effective DTR in autism.},

  abstract = {Mechanistic studies indicate that the oxomolybdenum(VI) bis(3,5-di-tert-butylcatecholate) fragment deoxygenates pyridine-N-oxides in a reaction where the oxygen is delivered to molyb-denum but the electrons for substrate reduction are drawn from the bound catecholate ligands, forming 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone. Inner-sphere redox reactions involve both changes in oxida-tion state and changes in bonding. Classically, in reactions such as the oxygen atom transfer (OAT) 1 reaction depicted in eqn (1a), the changes in oxidation state and those in bonding are co-localized: molybdenum is both oxidized and forms a new bond to oxygen, while nitrogen is reduced and the N–O bond is broken. Co-localization is not, however, obligatory. For example, in complexes with redox-active ligands, bonding changes may take place at a redox-inert metal center while the corresponding changes in oxidation state take place at the coordinated ligand (eqn (1b)). The most thoroughly studied example of such a ”non-classical” inner-sphere redox reaction is proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), where the motion of the hydrogen nucleus may be quite separated from the motion of the electron. 2 In contrast to PCET, nonclassical OAT (eqn (1b)) would be a two-electron redox process. ð1aÞ},

  abstract = {Policy implementation is a key component of scaling effective chronic disease prevention and management interventions. Policy can support scale-up by mandating or incentivizing intervention adoption, but enacting a policy is only the first step. Fully implementing a policy designed to facilitate implementation of health interventions often requires a range of accompanying implementation structures, like health IT systems, and implementation strategies, like training. Decision makers need to know what policies can support intervention adoption and how to implement those policies, but to date research on policy implementation is limited and innovative methodological approaches are needed. In December 2021, the Johns Hopkins ALACRITY Center for Health and Longevity in Mental Illness and the Johns Hopkins Center for Mental Health and Addiction Policy convened a forum of research experts to discuss approaches for studying policy implementation. In this report, we summarize the ideas that came out of the forum. First, we describe a motivating example focused on an Affordable Care Act Medicaid health home waiver policy used by some US states to support scale-up of an evidence-based integrated care model shown in clinical trials to improve cardiovascular care for people with serious mental illness. Second, we define key policy implementation components including structures, strategies, and outcomes. Third, we provide an overview of descriptive, predictive and associational, and causal approaches that can be used to study policy implementation. We conclude with discussion of priorities for methodological innovations in policy implementation research, with three key areas identified by forum experts: effect modification methods for making causal inferences about how policies’ effects on outcomes vary based on implementation structures/strategies; causal mediation approaches for studying policy implementation mechanisms; and characterizing uncertainty in systems science models. We conclude with discussion of overarching methods considerations for studying policy implementation, including measurement of policy implementation, strategies for studying the role of context in policy implementation, and the importance of considering when establishing causality is the goal of policy implementation research.},

  abstract = {Nationwide data are unavailable regarding changes in intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes and use of life support over the past 10 years, limiting understanding of practice changes.To portray the epidemiology of US critical care before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.Retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to an ICU for any reason, using data from the 54 US health systems continuously contributing to the Epic Cosmos database from 2014-2023.Patient demographics, COVID-19 status, and pandemic era.In-hospital mortality unadjusted and adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, and illness severity; ICU length of stay; and receipt of life-support interventions, including mechanical ventilation and vasopressor medications.Of 3\,453\,687 admissions including ICU care, median age was 65 (IQR, 53-75) years. Patients were 55.3\% male; 17.3\% Black and 6.1\% Hispanic or Latino; and overall in-hospital mortality was 10.9\%. The adjusted in-hospital mortality was elevated during the pandemic in COVID-negative (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.3 [95\% CI, 1.2-1.3]) and COVID-positive (aOR, 4.3 [95\% CI, 3.8-4.8]) patients and returned to baseline by mid-2022. The median ICU length of stay was 2.1 (IQR, 1.1-4.2) days, with increases during the pandemic among COVID-positive patients (difference for COVID-positive vs COVID-negative patients, 2.0 days [95\% CI, 2.0-2.1]). Rates of invasive mechanical ventilation were 23.2\% (95\% CI, 23.1\%-23.2\%) before the pandemic, increased to 25.8\% (95\% CI, 25.8\%-25.9\%) during the pandemic, and declined below prepandemic baseline thereafter (22.0\% [95\% CI, 21.9\%-22.2\%]). The use of vasopressors increased from 7.2\% to 21.6\% of ICU stays.Pandemic-era increases in length of stay and adjusted in-hospital mortality among US ICU patients returned to recent historical baselines. Fewer patients are now receiving mechanical ventilation than prior to the pandemic, while more patients are administered vasopressor medications.},

  abstract = {In the solid state, tris(3,5-di-tert-butylcatecholato)molybdenum(VI) forms a dimer with seven-coordinate molybdenum and bridging catecholates. NMR spectroscopy indicates that the dimeric structure is retained in solution. The molybdenum center has a high affinity for Lewis bases such as pyridine or pyridine-N-oxide, forming seven-coordinate monomers with a capped octahedral geometry, as illustrated by the solid-state structure of (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(py). Structural data indicate that the complexes are best considered as Mo(VI) with substantial π donation from the nonbridging catecholates to molybdenum. Both the dimeric and the monomeric tris(catecholates) react rapidly with water to form free catechol and oxomolybdenum bis(catecholate) complexes. Monooxomolybdenum complexes are also obtained, more slowly, on reaction with dioxygen, with organic products consisting mostly of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone with minor amounts of the extradiol oxidation product 4,6-di-tert-butyl-1-oxacyclohepta-4,6-diene-2,3-dione. The pyridine-N-oxide complex reacts on heating (with excess pyO) to form initially (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2MoO(Opy) and ultimately MoO3(Opy), with quinone and free pyridine as the only organic products. The decay of (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(Opy) shows an accelerated, autocatalytic profile because the oxidation of its product, (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2MoO(Opy), produces an oxo-rich, catecholate-poor intermediate which rapidly conproportionates with (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(Opy), providing an additional pathway for its conversion to the mono-oxo product. The tris(catecholate) fragment Mo(3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3 deoxygenates Opy in this nonclassical oxygen atom transfer reaction slightly less rapidly than does its oxidized product, MoO(3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2.},

  abstract = {There is a growing interest in leveraging the prevalence of mobile technology to improve health by delivering momentary, contextualized interventions to individuals’ smartphones. A just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) adjusts to an individual’s changing state and/or context to provide the right treatment, at the right time, in the right place. Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) allow for the collection of data which aid in the construction of an optimized JITAI by sequentially randomizing participants to different treatment options at each of many decision points throughout the study. Often, these data are collected passively using a mobile phone. To assess the causal effect of treatment on a near-term outcome, care must be taken when designing the data collection system to ensure it is of appropriately high quality. Here, we make several recommendations for collecting and managing data from an MRT. We provide advice on selecting which features to collect and when, choosing between “agents” to implement randomization, identifying sources of missing data, and overcoming other novel challenges. The recommendations are informed by our experience with HeartSteps, an MRT designed to test the effects of an intervention aimed at increasing physical activity in sedentary adults. We also provide a checklist which can be used in designing a data collection system so that scientists can focus more on their questions of interest, and less on cleaning data.},

  abstract = {Clinicians and researchers alike are increasingly interested in how best to personalize interventions. A dynamic treatment regimen is a sequence of prespecified decision rules which can be used to guide the delivery of a sequence of treatments or interventions that is tailored to the changing needs of the individual. The sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial is a research tool which allows for the construction of effective dynamic treatment regimens. We derive easy-to-use formulae for computing the total sample size for three common two-stage sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial designs in which the primary aim is to compare mean end-of-study outcomes for two embedded dynamic treatment regimens which recommend different first-stage treatments. The formulae are derived in the context of a regression model which leverages information from a longitudinal outcome collected over the entire study. We show that the sample size formula for a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial can be written as the product of the sample size formula for a standard two-arm randomized trial, a deflation factor that accounts for the increased statistical efficiency resulting from a longitudinal analysis, and an inflation factor that accounts for the design of a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial. The sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial design inflation factor is typically a function of the anticipated probability of response to first-stage treatment. We review modeling and estimation for dynamic treatment regimen effect analyses using a longitudinal outcome from a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial, as well as the estimation of standard errors. We also present estimators for the covariance matrix for a variety of common working correlation structures. Methods are motivated using the ENGAGE study, a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial aimed at developing a dynamic treatment regimen for increasing motivation to attend treatments among alcohol- and cocaine-dependent patients.},

  abstract = {Target trial emulation is an approach to designing rigorous nonexperimental studies by “emulating” key features of a clinical trial. Most commonly used outside of policy contexts, this approach is also valuable for policy evaluation as policies typically are not randomly assigned. In this article, we discuss the application of the target trial emulation framework in a policy evaluation context. The policy trial emulation framework includes 7 components: the units and eligibility criteria, definitions of the exposure and comparison conditions, assignment mechanism, baseline (“time zero”) and follow-up, outcomes, causal estimand, and statistical analysis and assumptions. Policy evaluations that emulate a randomized trial across these dimensions can yield estimates of the causal effects of the policy on outcomes. Using the policy trial emulation framework to conduct and report on research design and methods supports transparent assessment of threats to causal inference in nonexperimental studies intended to assess the effect of a health policy on clinical or population health outcomes.},

Interviewees described the intensive process of agency integration and identified primarily positive (e.g., decreased administrative burden) impacts of integration. Quantitative analyses indicated no effects of integration on receipt of mental health-related services among people with co-occurring conditions. While leaders identified some potentially beneficial impacts of state agency integration, the limited impact of integration beyond the agency suggests that interventions at multiple levels of the service system, including those targeting providers, are needed to better meet the mental health service needs for this population.},

PrEP coverage (prescriptions per 100,000 population) increased over time but was not statistically significantly associated with Medicaid expansion. There were, however, significant increases in the PrEP-to-need ratio (4.44 PrEP prescriptions per new HIV diagnosis) that were attributable to Medicaid expansion, with the strength of effects increasing over time. Medicaid expansion was associated with significant increases in PrEP-to-need ratios across all subgroups. Although Medicaid expansion effectively increased PrEP access relative to HIV diagnoses, differential impacts by race and ethnicity may suggest widening racial and ethnic disparities.},

  abstract = {Noninvasive prognostic biomarkers to inform clinical decision-making are an urgent unmet need for the management of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). We previously showed that higher circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) concentration is associated with worse survival in GBM. However, the biology underlying this is unknown.We prospectively enrolled 129 patients with treatment-naïve GBM with blood drawn prior to initial resection (baseline) and at the time of the first postradiotherapy MRI. We performed ccfDNA methylation deconvolution to determine cellular sources of ccfDNA. ELISA was performed to detect citrullinated histone 3 (citH3), a marker of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Multiplex proteomic analysis was used to measure soluble inflammatory proteins.We found that neutrophils contributed the highest proportion of prognostic ccfDNA. The percentage of ccfDNA derived from neutrophils was correlated with total [ccfDNA] but only in patients receiving preoperative corticosteroids. At baseline and on therapy, [citH3] was significantly higher in the plasma of patients with GBM receiving corticosteroids compared with corticosteroid-naïve GBM or no-cancer controls. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of ccfDNA methylation patterns yielded two clusters, with one enriched for patients with the NETosis phenotype and who received corticosteroids. Unsupervised clustering of circulating inflammatory proteins yielded similar results.These data suggest neutrophil-mediated NETosis is the dominant source of prognostic ccfDNA in patients with GBM and may be associated with glucocorticoid exposure. If further studies show that pharmacological inhibition of NETosis can mitigate the deleterious effects of corticosteroids, these plasma markers will have important clinical utility as noninvasive correlative biomarkers.},
